-- 1. Create a view with the name samsBills to allow the waiter Sam Pitt to see the bills he has taken. It should have columns in that order: first_name, surname, bill_date, cust_name, and bill_total:

CREATE VIEW samsBills
AS
SELECT first_name, surname, bill_date, cust_name, bill_total
FROM restStaff S
INNER JOIN restBill B
ON S.staff_no = B.waiter_no
WHERE first_name = "Sam" AND surname = "Pitt";

SELECT * FROM samsBills;

-- 2. Suppose Sam knows a bit of SQL. Write a query using the samsBills view so he can see only bills over Â£400:

SELECT * FROM samsBills WHERE bill_total > 400;

-- 3. Create a view with the name roomTotals to allow management to see how much each room has taken. The columns should be named: room_name and total_sum:

CREATE VIEW roomTotals
AS 
SELECT room_name, SUM(bill_total) AS "total_sum"
FROM restRest_table T
INNER JOIN restBill B
ON T.table_no = B.table_no
GROUP BY room_name;

SELECT * FROM roomTotals;

-- 4. Create a view with the name teamTotals to allow management to see how much each team has taken. Please concatenate the first name and the surname of the waiter with the space in between. The columns should be named: headwaiter_name and total_sum:

CREATE VIEW teamTotals
AS
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', surname) AS headwaiter_name , H.bill AS total_sum
FROM restStaff S2 
INNER JOIN
	(SELECT headwaiter, SUM(W.BT) AS bill
	FROM restStaff S1
	INNER JOIN 
		(SELECT waiter_no, SUM(bill_total) AS BT
		FROM restStaff S1
		INNER JOIN restBill B
		ON S1.staff_no = B.waiter_no
		GROUP BY waiter_no) W
	ON S1.staff_no = W.waiter_no
	GROUP BY headwaiter) H
ON S2.staff_no = H.headwaiter;

SELECT * FROM teamTotals;
